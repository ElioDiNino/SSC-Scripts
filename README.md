# UBC SSC Scripts
This repository is home to different scripts for checking when new information (that isn't otherwise emailed at all or in a timely fashion) becomes available on [UBC's SSC](https://ssc.adm.ubc.ca/).

## Current Scripts

[`grades.py`](/src/grades.py) - For getting notified when new grades are released

[`specs.py`](/src/specs.py) - For first year engineering students to get notified when Engineering Specializations have been released

## Usage Instructions

3. Visit this [link](https://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/index.html) and find the folder with the closest version to your Google Chrome version
4. Download the appropriate zip file for your system and extract the contents
